[PROBLEM]
Expected Value of Playing Cards 

Assume that **A** = 1, **J** = 11, **Q** = 12, **K** = 13.

a) What is the expected value of a randomly drawn card from a standard deck?
b) If you draw two cards randomly, what is the expected value of their sum?

[SOLUTION]
a)
Let $X$ be the value of the random card being drawn. In a standard deck, we have 4 cards each of values 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, 12, 13. Each card has probability $\frac{1}{52}$ of being drawn.

$E[X] = \frac{1}{52} \times 4 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 13) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{13 \times 14}{2} = 7$

b) 
Let $X,Y$ be the values of card number 1 and card number 2 respectively out of the two cards that are to be drawn. We know that for any arbitrary card, its expected value is $7$ from part $A$ so, $E[X]=E[Y]=7$.
By Linearity of Expectation, we know that $E[X + Y] = E[X]+E[Y] = 14$
