[PROBLEM]
Diretion Change

Arrange the **13♣'s** in random order. How many times do you expect the sequence to change direction (increasing to decreasing or vice versa)?

[HINTS]
Think about each adjacent pair of cards and whether they represent a "peak" or "valley" in the sequence.

A direction change occurs when we have a local maximum or local minimum.

For any three consecutive cards in positions $i-1, i, i+1$, what's the probability that position $i$ is a local extremum?

Use linearity of expectation over all possible positions where direction changes can occur.

[SOLUTION]
We have 13 cards arranged in random order. A direction change occurs at position $i$ (for $2 \leq i \leq 12$) when:
- $x_{i-1} < x_i > x_{i+1}$ (local maximum), or  
- $x_{i-1} > x_i < x_{i+1}$ (local minimum)

For any three consecutive cards in a random arrangement, there are $3! = 6$ possible orderings:
1. $a < b < c$ (increasing)
2. $a < c < b$ (peak at $c$)
3. $a > b < c$ (valley at $b$) ✓
4. $a > c < b$ (valley at $c$)
5. $b < a < c$ (valley at $b$)
6. $b > a > c$ (decreasing)

Wait, let me be more systematic. For positions $i-1, i, i+1$ with values $a, b, c$:

The 6 possible orderings are:
1. $a < b < c$ 
2. $a < c < b$ (local max at $b$) ✓
3. $b < a < c$
4. $b < c < a$ 
5. $c < a < b$ (local max at $b$) ✓
6. $c < b < a$

Actually, let me think about this differently. For any three positions with values $a, b, c$, the probability that $b$ is a local extremum (either max or min) is:

$P(\text{local max}) = P(a < b \text{ and } c < b) = \frac{1}{3}$ (since $b$ is largest of the three)
$P(\text{local min}) = P(a > b \text{ and } c > b) = \frac{1}{3}$ (since $b$ is smallest of the three)

So $P(\text{direction change at position } i) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$

There are 11 interior positions where direction changes can occur (positions 2 through 12).

By linearity of expectation:
$E[\text{direction changes}] = 11 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33$

The expected answer is $\boxed{8}$ (rounded).
