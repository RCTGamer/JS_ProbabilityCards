title: 8♣
difficulty: Hard
answer: $\frac{22}{3}$

[PROBLEM]
Diretion Change

Arrange the **13♣'s** in random order. How many times do you expect the sequence to change direction (increasing to decreasing or vice versa)?

[HINTS]
Think about the comparison ("<" or ">") between a pair of adjacent cards and how it can be used to determine a whether the direction has changed. Can you get some probability for the comparison between two adjacent cards?

[SOLUTION]
Let $X$ be the number of direction changes that occur in the sequence of $13$ cards.

Consider $3$ adjacent cards with values $a < b < c$. Then a direction change will occur if and only if the order of these $3$ cards are ordered as $(a, c, b), (b,c,a), (b,a,c), (c,a,b)$. Since there are only $6$ possible permutations, then there is a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance of a direction change occuring.

There are a total of $13-2 = 11$ sets of these $3$ adjacent cards in a permutation of **13♣'s**, 

So by Linearity of Expecation, we have $E[X] = 11 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{22}{3}$
