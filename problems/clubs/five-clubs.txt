[PROBLEM]
Two Jokers

While inserting two jokers into a deck of cards, we unfortunately drop the **5♣** on the floor. We then shuffle the deck. What's the expected number of cards between the two jokers?

[HINTS]
Think about the deck without the 5♣. How many cards are there?

Consider the positions of the two jokers among all possible arrangements.

Use the fact that if we have $n$ cards total, and we place two jokers randomly, we can think of this as dividing the cards into 3 groups.

The symmetry of the problem suggests that each of the 3 sections (before first joker, between jokers, after second joker) should have the same expected size.

[SOLUTION]
After dropping the 5♣, we have 51 cards plus 2 jokers, for a total of 53 cards.

When we place the 2 jokers randomly among these 53 positions, we create 3 sections:
1. Cards before the first joker
2. Cards between the two jokers  
3. Cards after the second joker

By symmetry, each section has the same expected number of cards.

Since we have 51 regular cards total, and they're divided equally among 3 sections:
Expected cards in each section = $\frac{51}{3} = 17$

Therefore, the expected number of cards between the two jokers is $\boxed{17}$.
