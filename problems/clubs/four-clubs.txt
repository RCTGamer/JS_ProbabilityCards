[PROBLEM]
Handshake Problem

$10$ people are sitting in a circle. Each has their own deck of cards. They each shuffle their deck and draw a random card. If the card is red, the holder turns to shake hands with the player to their left. If the card is black, they turn to shake hands with the person to their right. How many handshakes are expected to succeed?

[HINTS]
Consider the expected number of handshakes between each a single pair of adjacent players.

[SOLUTION]
Let $X_{i,i+1}$ be the indicator variable where person $i$ and person $i+1$ both shake hands (person 10 and person 1 for $i=10$). Then $X_{i,i+1}$ only occurs when person $i$ draws a card which makes him face person $i+1$ and vice-versa. This happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ 
Therefore, $P(X_{i,i+1}) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \implies E[X_{i,i+1}] = \frac{1}{4}$. 

By Linearity of Expectation, we know that $E[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{10} X_{i,i+1}] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{10} E[X_{i,i+1}] = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 2.5$

Therefore, out of $10$ possible handshakes, we expect $2.5$ of them to succeed
