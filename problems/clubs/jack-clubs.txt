[PROBLEM]
Extended Drunk Passenger Problem

We have $2N$ cards: 1 through $N$ of both ♣ and ♠. Remove the **1♣** and a random ♠. Remove a pair of cards: the **2♣** and an associated ♠ (the **2♠** if you can find it, else a random ♠). Continue similarly (with the 3♣, 4♣, etc) until all cards are paired and removed.

a) What's the chance $N$♣ and $N$♠ form a pair? (If your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$, answer $100a + b$)
b) On average, how many pairs have matching rank?

[HINTS]
Consider the Drunk Passenger Problem for a) 

[SOLUTION]
(a) Probability that $N$♣ and $N$♠ form a pair.

This is similar to the "drunk passenger problem"

Note this is equivalent to the probability that **1♠** is chosen before $N$♠ (which is $\frac{1}{2}$). To show why: 

First note that we have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of **1♠** being picked rather than $N$♠. (where the first option guarantees that $N$♣ and $N$♠ form a pair while the second option guarantees it does not happen)

Otherwise, suppose that the random ♠ removed when removing **1♣** the the $K$♠, When we reach the $K$♣, we then again have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance in selecting the **1♠** is chosen before $N$♠

So the K♣ "turns" into the new **1♣** we can repeatedly apply this logic. 

This gives a final probability of $\frac{1}{2}$
