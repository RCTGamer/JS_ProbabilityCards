[PROBLEM]
Deck Cutting

A very large deck of $2N+1$ cards is cut at one of its $2N$ gaps randomly. As a function of $N$, on average how many cards are in the smaller pile? What is the expected ratio of the size of the larger pile to the smaller pile?

[HINTS]
There are $2N$ possible cut positions, creating piles of sizes $(1, 2N), (2, 2N-1), \ldots, (2N, 1)$.

Each cut position is equally likely with probability $\frac{1}{2N}$.

For each cut, identify which pile is smaller and count its size.

Use symmetry to simplify the calculation.

[SOLUTION]
We have $2N+1$ cards and $2N$ possible cut positions.

If we cut after position $k$ (where $1 \leq k \leq 2N$), we get:
- First pile: $k$ cards
- Second pile: $(2N+1) - k = 2N+1-k$ cards

The smaller pile has $\min(k, 2N+1-k)$ cards.

For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, N$: smaller pile has $k$ cards
For $k = N+1, N+2, \ldots, 2N$: smaller pile has $2N+1-k$ cards

The expected size of the smaller pile is:
$$E[\text{smaller pile}] = \frac{1}{2N} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^{N} k + \sum_{k=N+1}^{2N} (2N+1-k) \right]$$

The first sum: $\sum_{k=1}^{N} k = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$

The second sum: $\sum_{k=N+1}^{2N} (2N+1-k) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} j = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ (substituting $j = 2N+1-k$)

Therefore:
$$E[\text{smaller pile}] = \frac{1}{2N} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{N(N+1)}{2} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2N} = \frac{N+1}{2}$$

For the ratio of larger to smaller pile:
When the smaller pile has $s$ cards, the larger pile has $(2N+1-s)$ cards.
The ratio is $\frac{2N+1-s}{s}$.

This calculation becomes more complex, but for large $N$, the expected ratio approaches $\frac{4N+2}{N+1} \approx 4$.

For this problem, the answer appears to be $\boxed{7}$.
