[PROBLEM]
One-to-One Matching

While showing off a fancy shuffling trick, you accidentally drop almost half the deck down a storm drain. You want to figure out which cards you still have, so you try to match up cards with the same rank and color (2♣ with 2♠ for example). You count 34 cards remaining. How many matches do you find on average?

[HINTS]
Think about the probability of forming a pair and the total number of pairs

[SOLUTION]
In a full deck of 52 cards, note that we have 26 matches out of the $\binom{52}{2} = \frac{52(51)}{2} = 26\cdot 51$ possible pairs. Therefore, any arbitrary pair chosen has a probability of $\frac{26}{\frac{26}{51}} = \frac{1}{51}$.

Next, if we have $34$ cards remaining, we have a total of $\binom{34}{2} = \frac{34 \cdot 33}{2}$ pairs. 

So by linearity of expectation, we have $E[X] = \frac{34\cdot 33}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{51} = 11$
