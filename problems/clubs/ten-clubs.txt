[PROBLEM]
Drawing three cards

Draw cards from a shuffled deck until you draw the **J♣, Q♣,** and **K♣**. How many draws will it take on average?

[HINTS]
This is similar to the coupon collector problem, but we only need to collect 3 specific cards.

Think about this as waiting for the last of the three target cards to appear.

The expected position of the $k$-th largest value in a random permutation of $n$ items is $\frac{k(n+1)}{n+1-k+1}$.

Alternatively, think about the expected position of the maximum of the three target cards.

[SOLUTION]
We need to find the expected number of draws until we have seen all three cards: J♣, Q♣, and K♣.

This is equivalent to finding the expected position of the last of these three cards to appear in a random shuffling of the deck.

Let the positions of J♣, Q♣, and K♣ in the shuffled deck be $X_1, X_2, X_3$ respectively. We want $E[\max(X_1, X_2, X_3)]$.

For three cards randomly placed in a deck of 52 cards, the expected position of the maximum is:
$$E[\max(X_1, X_2, X_3)] = \frac{3 \cdot 53}{3 + 1} = \frac{159}{4} = 39.75$$

More generally, for $k$ specific cards in a deck of $n$ cards:
$$E[\text{position of last card}] = \frac{k(n+1)}{k+1}$$

With $k=3$ and $n=52$:
$$E[\text{draws needed}] = \frac{3 \cdot 53}{4} = \frac{159}{4} = 39.75$$

The expected answer is approximately $\boxed{40}$.
