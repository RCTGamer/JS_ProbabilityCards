[PROBLEM]
Card Redistribution Problem

$20$ people are each holding a playing card. These cards are all shuffled and redistributed randomly. What is the expected number of people who get their original card back?

[HINTS]
Use indicator random variables for each person.

Apply linearity of expectation.

Each person has probability 1/20 of getting their original card back.

[SOLUTION]
Using indicator random variables:
Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable that equals 1 if person $i$ gets their original card back, and 0 otherwise.
We want to find $E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{20}]$.

Using linearity of expectation:
$E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{20}] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_{20}]$
Since all people are equivalent: $E[X_i] = E[X_1]$ for all $i$.

---

Calculating the probability:
$P(\text{person 1 gets their card back}) = \frac{1}{20}$
Therefore: $E[X_1] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{20} + 0 \cdot \frac{19}{20} = \frac{1}{20}$

---

Final answer:
$E[\text{total}] = 20 \cdot \frac{1}{20} = 1$

This is a classic result: in any random permutation of $n$ objects, the expected number of fixed points is always 1, regardless of $n$.
