[PROBLEM]
Card Redistribution Problem

$20$ people are each holding a playing card. These cards are all shuffled and redistributed randomly. What is the expected number of people who get their original card back?

[SOLUTION]
Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable that equals $1$ if person $i$ gets their original card back, and $0$ otherwise.
We know that $E[X_i] = P(X=1) = \frac{1}{20}$ and we want to find $E[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{20} X_i] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{20} E[X_i] = 20\cdot \frac{1}{20} = 1$
