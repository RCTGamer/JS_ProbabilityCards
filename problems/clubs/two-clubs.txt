[PROBLEM]
Drawing Cards Until Success

A standard deck of cards is shuffled. On average, how many cards will you have to draw to get the A♣ if:

a) You draw with replacement?
b) You draw without replacement?

[SOLUTION]
a) Drawing with replacement:
Each draw has probability $\frac{1}{52}$ of success (or drawing the A♣).
Expected number of trials until first success: $E[X] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{1/52} = 52$.
To understand why this holds, search Expectation of Geometric RVS.

b) Drawing without replacement:
Let $X$ be the number of cards we draw before we get the A♣ without replacement. $X$ is equivalent to the position of A♣ in a randomly shuffled deck. Because each position is equally likely, then we have
$E[X] = \frac{1 + 2 + ... + 52}{52} = \frac{52 \times 53}{2 \times 52} = 26.5$
