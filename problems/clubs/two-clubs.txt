[CONFIG]
title: 2♣
difficulty: Easy
answers: a)=52, b)=26.5

[PROBLEM]
Drawing Cards Until Success

A standard deck of cards is shuffled. On average, how many cards will you have to draw to get the A♣ if:

a) You draw with replacement?
b) You draw without replacement?

[HINTS]
Part a: With replacement, each draw is independent with probability 1/52.

Part b: Without replacement, use the formula for expected position in a shuffled deck.

[SOLUTION]
Part a) Drawing with replacement:
Each draw has probability $\frac{1}{52}$ of success.
Expected number of trials until first success: $E[X] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{1/52} = 52$

---

Part b) Drawing without replacement:
The A♣ is equally likely to be in any of the 52 positions.
Expected position: $E[X] = \frac{1 + 2 + ... + 52}{52} = \frac{52 \times 53}{2 \times 52} = 26.5$
