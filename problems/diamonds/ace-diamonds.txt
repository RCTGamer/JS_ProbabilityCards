difficulty: Easy
answer: 413

[PROBLEM]
Simple Probabilities

A standard deck of cards is shuffled. What is the chance that the third card from the top is either a diamond or an ace?

(If your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$, Find $100a + b$)

[SOLUTION]
There are $13$ diamonds and $4$ aces in a deck. However, the A♦ is double counted, so we should remove subtract this. So there are $16$ cards which satisfies this condition.

This gives us a probability of $\frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}$
