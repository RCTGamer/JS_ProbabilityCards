[PROBLEM]
Different Probabilities?

A standard deck of cards is shuffled. What is the chance that the third card from the top is either a diamond or an ace?

[HINTS]
Think about the total number of cards that satisfy our condition: all diamonds plus any aces that aren't diamonds.

Remember that there are 13 diamonds in a standard deck and 4 aces (one in each suit).

[SOLUTION]
We need to calculate the probability that the third card is either a diamond or an ace.

First, let's count how many cards satisfy our condition:
- There are 13 diamonds in a standard 52-card deck
- There are 4 aces in a standard deck, one in each suit
- One of those aces is the Ace of Diamonds, which we've already counted
- So there are 13 + (4-1) = 16 cards that are either diamonds or aces

The probability that the third card is one of these 16 cards is:

$P(\text{third card is either a diamond or an ace}) = \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}$

This is approximately 0.308 or about 30.8%.
