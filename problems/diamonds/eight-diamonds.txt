[PROBLEM]
Diamond Mystery

We are playing with a standard deck. I remove one ♦ and some non-♦s but I don't tell you how many! I secretly flip a fair coin; on heads I return the missing ♦, on tails I return one of the other missing cards. You shuffle the deck and draw one card; it's a ♦. What's the probability my coin came up heads?

[HINTS]
Use Bayes Theorem to expand the needed probability from our given information

[SOLUTION]
$H$ = the event that the coin came up heads
$T$ = the event that the coin came up tails
$D$ = the event that you draw a diamond

We wish to find $P(H|D)$ and suppose that we have $k$ cards left after flipping our coin and getting a card back.

From Bayes' Theorem, we have

$P(H|D) = \frac{P(H\cap D)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D|H)P(H) + P(D|T)P(T)} = \frac{\frac{13}{k}\cdot 0.5}{\frac{13}{k} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{12}{k} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{13}{25}$
