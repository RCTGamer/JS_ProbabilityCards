[PROBLEM]
More Monty Hall

I have all $13$♦s. We both want to end the game with the **5♦**. You randomly select one of my cards but cannot look at it. I look at my cards and then place $11$ face up. The **5♦** is not among them.

a) Should you trade the card you initially chose for my remaining card?
b) What is the chance you find the **5♦** if so?

[HINTS]
Think about whether I would intentionally withhold the **5♦** or not.

[SOLUTION]
This is a variation of the Monty Hall Problem. 

We know that since "I" want to end the game with the **5♦**, then I would want to hold onto the **5♦**. Therefore, the $11$ cards thrown are not random but they are selected as the cards that are not **5♦**.

When "You" pick a card, you have a $\frac{1}{13}$ chance of it being the **5♦**, while I have a $\frac{12}{13}$ chance of still having the **5♦**. Since I simply discard all the cards that are not the **5♦**, then this probability stays the same and there is no new information regarding th setup of the game.

Therefore, the card that "I" am holding has a $\frac{12}{13}$ chance of being the **5♦**
