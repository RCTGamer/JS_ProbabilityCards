[PROBLEM]
Three Card Monte

The **2♦, 3♦, and 4♦** are face-down in random order. You want to select the **4♦**. You point to the leftmost card. A gust of wind blows, flipping the rightmost card and revealing that it is the **2♦**. Do you switch your choice from the leftmost to the middle?

[HINTS]
Think about what information you gain when the rightmost card is revealed to be the 2♦.

Consider all possible arrangements of the three cards and how your chances change.

[SOLUTION]
Initially, the 2♦, 3♦, and 4♦ are arranged randomly, and you choose the leftmost card. Let's analyze the situation:

First, let's enumerate all possible arrangements of the three cards (from left to right):
1. (2♦, 3♦, 4♦)
2. (2♦, 4♦, 3♦)
3. (3♦, 2♦, 4♦)
4. (3♦, 4♦, 2♦)
5. (4♦, 2♦, 3♦)
6. (4♦, 3♦, 2♦)

Each arrangement has a 1/6 probability.

You initially choose the leftmost card. Then the rightmost card is revealed to be the 2♦. This means we're in arrangement 4 or 5.

In arrangement 4 (3♦, 4♦, 2♦), the 4♦ is in the middle.
In arrangement 5 (4♦, 2♦, 3♦), the 4♦ is on the left (your initial choice).

Since arrangements 4 and 5 are equally likely (each had a 1/6 chance), and we're now restricted to just these two arrangements, each now has a 1/2 probability.

If you stick with the leftmost card, you'll win in arrangement 5, so your probability of winning is 1/2.
If you switch to the middle card, you'll win in arrangement 4, so your probability of winning is also 1/2.

Therefore, it doesn't matter whether you switch or not - your probability of selecting the 4♦ remains 1/2.

But wait, let's reconsider this. When the rightmost card is revealed to be the 2♦, we're left with the following possible arrangements:
- (3♦, 4♦, 2♦)
- (4♦, 3♦, 2♦)

We were actually in arrangements 4 or 6 from our original list. In arrangement 4, the 4♦ is in the middle. In arrangement 6, the 4♦ is on the left.

But I made a mistake. Let me redo the analysis.

When the rightmost card is revealed to be the 2♦, we're left with:
4. (3♦, 4♦, 2♦)
6. (4♦, 3♦, 2♦)

In arrangement 4, the 4♦ is in the middle.
In arrangement 6, the 4♦ is on the left (your initial choice).

So if you stick with your initial choice (the leftmost card), you'll win in arrangement 6.
If you switch to the middle card, you'll win in arrangement 4.

Since arrangements 4 and 6 are equally likely, your probability of winning is 1/2 whether you switch or not.

Therefore, it doesn't matter whether you switch or not - your probability of selecting the 4♦ remains 1/2.
