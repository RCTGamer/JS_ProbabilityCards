title: 4♦
difficulty: Easy
answer: 1

[PROBLEM]
Three Card Monte

The **2♦, 3♦, and 4♦** are face-down in random order. You want to select the **4♦**. You point to the leftmost card. A gust of wind blows, flipping the rightmost card and revealing that it is the **2♦**. Do you switch your choice from the leftmost to the middle?

(0 for yes and 1 for no)

[HINTS]
Think about what information you gain when the rightmost card is revealed to be the 2♦.

[SOLUTION]
First, note that since it is a gust of wind that blows the rightmost card, then we know that the card being opened is not intentionally "not a **4♦**".

Therefore, the new information that we know is that the rightmost card is a **2♦**. So, the **3♦** and **4♦** are equally likely to appear in either the leftmost or middle spot which changes the probability of our selection.

However, the probabilities of sticking with the leftmost side and the middle are both then $\frac{1}{2}$ so it does not matter if you change.
