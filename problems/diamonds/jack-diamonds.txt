[PROBLEM]
Card Matching Game

Consider the following game: place the **A♦-6♦** and the **A♠-6♠** in a bag. You randomly draw cards one at a time from the bag and keep them, but put matching cards aside as soon as they appear in your hand. The game ends and you lose if you ever hold three cards, no two of which match. What is the chance you win? (If your answer is in the form of $\frac{a}{b}$, write $1000a + b$)

[HINTS]
Consider the states where you have $i$th cards matched already.

[SOLUTION]

Let $X_i$ be the state where you have $1$ card in your hand and $i$ unmatched pairs left. We want to find $P(X_i \to X_{i-1})$.

Next, we define $Y$ to be the state where we have 0 cards in our hand and 6 pairs currently unmatched and $Z$ to be the state where we have 0 cards in our hand and all the cards have been matched.

Then note that $P(Y \to X_6) = 1$ and $P(X_1 \to Z) = 1$ too. Moreover, we note that if we know that $Y\to Z$ surely occured, then each of the $X_i \to X_{i+1}$ must have occured as well.

Knowing this, it suffices to find $P(X_{i} \to X_{i-1})$. Note that we simply consider two cases, either we draw the pair immediately (\frac{1}{2i-1}) then draw some random card (with probability 1), or we draw a second card, then pair either the first or second card with the third card drawn. Any other cases will lead to use losing the game.

Hence, we have $P(X_{i} \to X_{i-1}) = \frac{1}{2i-1} + \frac{2i-2}{2i-1} \cdot \frac{2}{2i-2} = \frac{3}{2i-1}$

Therefore, we have $P(Y\to Z) = P(Y\to X_6)P(X_6\to X_5)...P(X_2\to X_1) P(X_1 \to Z) = \frac{3^5}{11\cdot 9\cdot 7\cdot 5\cdot 3} = \frac{9}{385}$
