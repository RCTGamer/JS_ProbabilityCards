[PROBLEM]
Asymptotic Limit of LIS

[*] I have a very large deck of $N$ cards: the **A♦-N♦**. If I shuffle the deck, what is the chance that the longest increasing subsequence has more than $\sqrt{2N} + \sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$ cards?

[HINTS]
This problem relates to the asymptotic behavior of the longest increasing subsequence in random permutations.

Consider what happens as N approaches infinity and research the limit theorems related to the longest increasing subsequence.

[SOLUTION]
This problem relates to a deep result in probability theory concerning the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in random permutations.

For a random permutation of n numbers, let L_n be the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A remarkable theorem by Baik, Deift, and Johansson (1999) states that, as n approaches infinity, the distribution of the normalized quantity:

$\frac{L_n - 2\sqrt{n}}{n^{1/6}}$

approaches the Tracy-Widom distribution, which is related to the largest eigenvalue of a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).

In particular, the mean length of the longest increasing subsequence in a random permutation of n elements is asymptotically $2\sqrt{n}$, with fluctuations on the order of $n^{1/6}$.

The constant $\sqrt{8}$ in the problem statement relates to a specific quantile of the Tracy-Widom distribution. Specifically, the probability that:

$\frac{L_n - 2\sqrt{n}}{n^{1/6}} > \sqrt{8}$

approaches zero as n approaches infinity.

So, for very large n, the probability that $L_n > 2\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{8}n^{1/6}$ approaches 0.

In our problem, we have n = N, and we're asked for the probability that the LIS has more than $\sqrt{2N} + \sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$ cards. Using the above result, and noting that $\sqrt{2N} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{N}$, which is less than $2\sqrt{N}$ for large N, the probability approaches 0 as N becomes very large.

Specifically, the probability that $L_N > \sqrt{2N} + \sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$ is less than the probability that $L_N > 2\sqrt{N}$, which approaches 1/2 as N becomes very large (since $2\sqrt{N}$ is the mean of $L_N$). However, the exact probability would depend on the value of N and the specific properties of the Tracy-Widom distribution.

But since the problem asks for the "chance," which is a single value, and given the asymptotic nature of the result, we can conclude that the probability is 0.

Actually, I should be more careful. Let's restate the main result: for a random permutation of n numbers, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is, on average, approximately $2\sqrt{n}$ for large n, with fluctuations on the order of $n^{1/6}$.

So, for our problem, the expected length of the LIS for a random permutation of N cards is approximately $2\sqrt{N}$.

The problem asks for the probability that the LIS is longer than $\sqrt{2N} + \sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$. For large N, $\sqrt{2N}$ is less than $2\sqrt{N}$, so it might seem that the probability is close to 1. But we also have the additional term $\sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$, which grows more slowly than $\sqrt{N}$ but can still be significant.

According to the Tracy-Widom distribution, the probability that $L_N$ exceeds its mean by more than $\sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$ is very small for large N. So, the probability that $L_N > 2\sqrt{N} + \sqrt{8}N^{1/6}$ approaches 0 as N becomes very large.

Given that the problem is asking for the chance, and considering the asymptotic nature of the result, the answer is 0.
