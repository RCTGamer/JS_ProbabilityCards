title: 9♦
difficulty: Medium
answer: 1

[PROBLEM]
Easy Problem?

Which of these events is most likely assuming cards are drawn from a shuffled deck with replacement:
a) at least 1 ♦ when 4 cards are drawn
b) at least 2 ♦ when 8 cards are drawn
c) at least 3 ♦ when 12 cards are drawn

[HINTS]
For each scenario, use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability.

Remember that the probability of drawing a diamond in a single draw is 1/4.

[SOLUTION]
Let's calculate the probability of each event:

The probability of drawing a diamond in a single draw is 13/52 = 1/4 = 0.25.

a) At least 1 ♦ when 4 cards are drawn:
P(at least 1 ♦) = 1 - P(0 ♦)
P(0 ♦) = (3/4)^4 = 0.31640625
P(at least 1 ♦) = 1 - 0.31640625 = 0.68359375

b) At least 2 ♦ when 8 cards are drawn:
P(at least 2 ♦) = 1 - P(0 ♦) - P(1 ♦)
P(0 ♦) = (3/4)^8 = 0.10011394
P(1 ♦) = 8 × (1/4) × (3/4)^7 = 8 × 0.25 × 0.13348525 = 0.26697050
P(at least 2 ♦) = 1 - 0.10011394 - 0.26697050 = 0.63291556

c) At least 3 ♦ when 12 cards are drawn:
P(at least 3 ♦) = 1 - P(0 ♦) - P(1 ♦) - P(2 ♦)
P(0 ♦) = (3/4)^12 = 0.03169902
P(1 ♦) = 12 × (1/4) × (3/4)^11 = 12 × 0.25 × 0.04226536 = 0.12679607
P(2 ♦) = (12 choose 2) × (1/4)^2 × (3/4)^10 = 66 × 0.0625 × 0.05635381 = 0.23266945
P(at least 3 ♦) = 1 - 0.03169902 - 0.12679607 - 0.23266945 = 0.60883546

Comparing the three probabilities:
a) P(at least 1 ♦ in 4 draws) = 0.68359375
b) P(at least 2 ♦ in 8 draws) = 0.63291556
c) P(at least 3 ♦ in 12 draws) = 0.60883546

Therefore, event a) is the most likely: drawing at least 1 diamond when 4 cards are drawn.

Let me verify the calculations:

a) P(at least 1 ♦ in 4 draws) = 1 - (3/4)^4 = 1 - 0.31640625 = 0.68359375

b) P(at least 2 ♦ in 8 draws) = 1 - P(0 ♦) - P(1 ♦)
   P(0 ♦) = (3/4)^8 = 0.10011394
   P(1 ♦) = 8C1 × (1/4)^1 × (3/4)^7 = 8 × 0.25 × 0.13348525 = 0.26697050
   P(at least 2 ♦) = 1 - 0.10011394 - 0.26697050 = 0.63291556

c) P(at least 3 ♦ in 12 draws) = 1 - P(0 ♦) - P(1 ♦) - P(2 ♦)
   P(0 ♦) = (3/4)^12 = 0.03169902
   P(1 ♦) = 12C1 × (1/4)^1 × (3/4)^11 = 12 × 0.25 × 0.04226536 = 0.12679607
   P(2 ♦) = 12C2 × (1/4)^2 × (3/4)^10 = 66 × 0.0625 × 0.05635381 = 0.23266945
   P(at least 3 ♦) = 1 - 0.03169902 - 0.12679607 - 0.23266945 = 0.60883546

So the answer is a): at least 1 ♦ when 4 cards are drawn is the most likely event.
