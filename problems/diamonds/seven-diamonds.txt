[PROBLEM]
Truthful and Lying Card Holders

You are holding a random card from a standard deck. If you have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 90% of the time and lie 10% of the time. If you don't have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 40% of the time and lie 60% of the time. I ask "Do you have a ♦?" and you answer "Yes." What is the chance you have a ♦?

[HINTS]
Use Bayes' Theorem to update the probability based on the observation.

Consider the different ways you could answer "Yes" - either truthfully (if you have a diamond) or deceptively (if you don't have a diamond).

[SOLUTION]
Let's solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- D = the event that you have a diamond
- Y = the event that you answer "Yes"

We want to find P(D|Y), the probability that you have a diamond given that you answered "Yes."

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(D|Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) / P(Y)

Given information:
- P(D) = 13/52 = 1/4 (probability of randomly drawing a diamond)
- P(Y|D) = 0.9 (if you have a diamond, you answer truthfully 90% of the time, so you say "Yes")
- P(Y|not D) = 0.6 (if you don't have a diamond, you lie 60% of the time, so you say "Yes")

We need to find P(Y) using the law of total probability:
P(Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) + P(Y|not D) × P(not D)
P(Y) = 0.9 × (1/4) + 0.6 × (3/4)
P(Y) = 0.225 + 0.45 = 0.675

Now we can calculate P(D|Y):
P(D|Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) / P(Y)
P(D|Y) = 0.9 × (1/4) / 0.675
P(D|Y) = 0.225 / 0.675 = 1/3

Wait, I need to be more careful with the problem statement. Let me reconsider:

"If you have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 90% of the time and lie 10% of the time."
This means P(Y|D) = 0.9, because if you have a diamond, you answer truthfully ("Yes") 90% of the time.

"If you don't have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 40% of the time and lie 60% of the time."
This means P(Y|not D) = 0.6, because if you don't have a diamond, you answer untruthfully ("Yes") 60% of the time.

Let's recalculate:
P(Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) + P(Y|not D) × P(not D)
P(Y) = 0.9 × (1/4) + 0.6 × (3/4)
P(Y) = 0.225 + 0.45 = 0.675

P(D|Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) / P(Y)
P(D|Y) = 0.9 × (1/4) / 0.675
P(D|Y) = 0.225 / 0.675 = 1/3

Actually, wait. Let me carefully analyze this again.

P(D) = 13/52 = 1/4 (probability of randomly drawing a diamond)
P(not D) = 39/52 = 3/4 (probability of not drawing a diamond)

If you have a diamond (D), then:
- P(answer truthfully|D) = 0.9
- P(answer "Yes"|D) = P(answer truthfully|D) = 0.9 (because "Yes" is the truthful answer)

If you don't have a diamond (not D), then:
- P(answer truthfully|not D) = 0.4
- P(answer "Yes"|not D) = P(not answer truthfully|not D) = 0.6 (because "Yes" is the untruthful answer)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(D|Y) = P(Y|D) × P(D) / [P(Y|D) × P(D) + P(Y|not D) × P(not D)]
P(D|Y) = 0.9 × (1/4) / [0.9 × (1/4) + 0.6 × (3/4)]
P(D|Y) = 0.225 / [0.225 + 0.45]
P(D|Y) = 0.225 / 0.675 = 1/3

So the probability that you have a diamond given that you answered "Yes" is 1/3 or approximately 0.333.
