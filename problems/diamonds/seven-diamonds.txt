title: 7♦
difficulty: Medium
answer: $\frac{1}{3}$

[PROBLEM]
Truthful and Lying Card Holders

You are holding a random card from a standard deck. If you have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 90% of the time and lie 10% of the time. If you don't have a ♦, you truthfully answer questions 40% of the time and lie 60% of the time. I ask "Do you have a ♦?" and you answer "Yes." What is the chance you have a ♦?

[HINTS]
Use Bayes' Theorem and expand it to fit our given variables.

[SOLUTION]
Let's solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
$D$ to be the event that you have a diamond
$ND$ to be the event that you don't have a diamond
$Y$ to be the event that you answer "Yes"

We want to find $P(D|Y)$ and we can use Bayes Theorem to compute for this

$P(D|Y) = \frac{P(D\cap Y)}{P(Y)} = \frac{P(Y|D)P(D)}{P(Y \cap D) + P(Y \cap ND)} = \frac{P(Y|D)P(D)}{P(Y|D)P(D) + P(Y|ND)P(ND)} = \frac{0.9\cdot 0.25}{0.9\cdot 0.25 + 0.6\cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.45} = \frac{1}{3}$
