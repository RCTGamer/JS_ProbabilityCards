[PROBLEM]
New Deck vs. Shuffled Deck

You are given a deck of cards that is equally likely to either be perfectly shuffled or brand new (i.e. ordered A♦-K♦, A♠-K♠, etc). You draw the top 3 cards and they are the **A♦, 2♦, and 3♦** in that order. How much more likely is the deck to be brand new vs. shuffled?

[HINTS]
Use Bayes' Theorem to update your beliefs based on the observed evidence.

Think about the probability of drawing those specific three cards in that specific order from a brand new deck versus from a shuffled deck.

[SOLUTION]
Let's use Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem.

Let's denote:
- N = the event that the deck is brand new
- S = the event that the deck is shuffled
- E = the event that we draw A♦, 2♦, and 3♦ in that order

We want to find the ratio: P(N|E) / P(S|E)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(N|E) = P(E|N) × P(N) / P(E)
P(S|E) = P(E|S) × P(S) / P(E)

So P(N|E) / P(S|E) = [P(E|N) × P(N)] / [P(E|S) × P(S)]

Given that the deck is equally likely to be new or shuffled, P(N) = P(S) = 1/2.

So P(N|E) / P(S|E) = P(E|N) / P(E|S)

Now we need to calculate P(E|N) and P(E|S).

If the deck is brand new (N), then drawing A♦, 2♦, and 3♦ in that order happens with certainty, since these are the first three cards in a brand new deck.
Therefore, P(E|N) = 1.

If the deck is shuffled (S), then the probability of drawing those specific three cards in that specific order is:
P(E|S) = 1/52 × 1/51 × 1/50 = 1/(52 × 51 × 50) = 1/132600

Therefore:
P(N|E) / P(S|E) = P(E|N) / P(E|S) = 1 / (1/132600) = 132600

So the deck is 132,600 times more likely to be brand new than shuffled.

Wait, I need to double-check my calculation for P(E|S).

If the deck is shuffled (S), we need the probability of drawing specifically A♦, 2♦, and 3♦ in that exact order. This is:
- Probability of drawing A♦ first: 1/52
- Probability of drawing 2♦ second, given A♦ was drawn first: 1/51
- Probability of drawing 3♦ third, given A♦ and 2♦ were drawn first and second: 1/50

So P(E|S) = 1/52 × 1/51 × 1/50 = 1/(52 × 51 × 50)

This equals approximately 7.53 × 10^-6 or about 1 in 132,600.

Therefore:
P(N|E) / P(S|E) = 1 / (7.53 × 10^-6) ≈ 132,600

So the deck is approximately 132,600 times more likely to be brand new than shuffled.

Let me double-check my arithmetic:
52 × 51 × 50 = 52 × 2550 = 132,600

So the answer is confirmed: the deck is 132,600 times more likely to be brand new than shuffled.
