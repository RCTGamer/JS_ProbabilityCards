[PROBLEM]
Optimal Card Strategy

You have two strange decks of cards: deck A with 2 ♦s and 1 ♠ and deck B with 51 ♦s and 50 ♠s. You randomly choose a deck and draw. You can look at the color of the card, put it back in the deck (or not) and draw a second card. Your goal is to guess which deck you are drawing from. What strategy do you employ and how likely is it to succeed?

[HINTS]
Think about how you can maximize your information about which deck you're drawing from.

Consider the conditional probabilities after seeing the first card and how they should influence your second draw.

[SOLUTION]
This problem is asking us to determine the optimal strategy for deciding which deck we're drawing from, and the probability of success with that strategy.

Let's start by denoting:
- A = the event that we're drawing from deck A
- B = the event that we're drawing from deck B
- D = the event that we draw a diamond
- S = the event that we draw a spade

We randomly choose a deck, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

For deck A:
- P(D|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing a diamond from deck A)
- P(S|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing a spade from deck A)

For deck B:
- P(D|B) = 51/101 ≈ 0.505 (probability of drawing a diamond from deck B)
- P(S|B) = 50/101 ≈ 0.495 (probability of drawing a spade from deck B)

Now, let's think about our strategy. We draw a card, and based on what we see, we need to decide whether to put it back before drawing a second card.

The key insight is to maximize the difference in probabilities between the two decks. In deck A, diamonds are much more common relative to spades (2:1), while in deck B, the ratio is nearly 1:1.

Let's consider different strategies:

Strategy 1: If the first card is a diamond, put it back; if it's a spade, don't put it back.
- If we draw a diamond first, we put it back. In deck A, the probability of drawing a diamond again is still 2/3. In deck B, it's still about 0.505.
- If we draw a spade first, we don't put it back. In deck A, the probability of drawing a diamond next is 2/2 = 1. In deck B, it's 51/100 = 0.51.

Strategy 2: If the first card is a diamond, don't put it back; if it's a spade, put it back.
- If we draw a diamond first, we don't put it back. In deck A, the probability of drawing a diamond next is 1/2 = 0.5. In deck B, it's 50/100 = 0.5.
- If we draw a spade first, we put it back. In deck A, the probability of drawing a diamond next is 2/3. In deck B, it's about 0.505.

Neither strategy seems particularly good because the probabilities remain quite close.

But what if we draw two cards (with replacement) and base our decision on both draws?

For deck A:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444 (probability of drawing two diamonds from deck A)
- P(DS|A) = (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222 (probability of drawing a diamond then a spade from deck A)
- P(SD|A) = (1/3) × (2/3) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222 (probability of drawing a spade then a diamond from deck A)
- P(SS|A) = (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111 (probability of drawing two spades from deck A)

For deck B:
- P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.255 (probability of drawing two diamonds from deck B)
- P(DS|B) = (51/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.250 (probability of drawing a diamond then a spade from deck B)
- P(SD|B) = (50/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.250 (probability of drawing a spade then a diamond from deck B)
- P(SS|B) = (50/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.245 (probability of drawing two spades from deck B)

Based on these probabilities, our strategy should be:
- If we draw DD, guess deck A (since P(DD|A) > P(DD|B))
- If we draw DS, guess deck B (since P(DS|A) < P(DS|B))
- If we draw SD, guess deck B (since P(SD|A) < P(SD|B))
- If we draw SS, guess deck B (since P(SS|A) < P(SS|B))

Actually, I'm still making a mistake in my analysis. Let me start over, focusing on drawing two cards with replacement, and seeing which deck is more likely based on the observed pattern.

For deck A:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444
- P(DS|A) = (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222
- P(SD|A) = (1/3) × (2/3) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222
- P(SS|A) = (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111

For deck B:
- P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.255
- P(DS|B) = (51/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SD|B) = (50/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SS|B) = (50/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.245

Now, using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability of each deck given each observed pattern:

For DD:
- P(A|DD) = P(DD|A) × P(A) / [P(DD|A) × P(A) + P(DD|B) × P(B)]
- P(A|DD) = 0.444 × 0.5 / [0.444 × 0.5 + 0.255 × 0.5] ≈ 0.635

For DS or SD:
- P(A|DS) = P(DS|A) × P(A) / [P(DS|A) × P(A) + P(DS|B) × P(B)]
- P(A|DS) = 0.222 × 0.5 / [0.222 × 0.5 + 0.250 × 0.5] ≈ 0.470
- P(A|SD) is the same due to symmetry.

For SS:
- P(A|SS) = P(SS|A) × P(A) / [P(SS|A) × P(A) + P(SS|B) × P(B)]
- P(A|SS) = 0.111 × 0.5 / [0.111 × 0.5 + 0.245 × 0.5] ≈ 0.312

So our strategy is:
- If we observe DD, guess deck A (P(A|DD) ≈ 0.635)
- If we observe DS or SD, guess deck B (P(B|DS) = P(B|SD) ≈ 0.530)
- If we observe SS, guess deck B (P(B|SS) ≈ 0.688)

Now, let's calculate the probability of success with this strategy:
P(success) = P(DD) × P(A|DD) + P(DS) × P(B|DS) + P(SD) × P(B|SD) + P(SS) × P(B|SS)

First, we need to find P(DD), P(DS), etc. These are the overall probabilities of observing each pattern:

P(DD) = P(DD|A) × P(A) + P(DD|B) × P(B) = 0.444 × 0.5 + 0.255 × 0.5 ≈ 0.350
P(DS) = P(DS|A) × P(A) + P(DS|B) × P(B) = 0.222 × 0.5 + 0.250 × 0.5 ≈ 0.236
P(SD) = P(SD|A) × P(A) + P(SD|B) × P(B) = 0.222 × 0.5 + 0.250 × 0.5 ≈ 0.236
P(SS) = P(SS|A) × P(A) + P(SS|B) × P(B) = 0.111 × 0.5 + 0.245 × 0.5 ≈ 0.178

Now we can calculate P(success):
P(success) = 0.350 × 0.635 + 0.236 × 0.530 + 0.236 × 0.530 + 0.178 × 0.688
P(success) ≈ 0.222 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.122 = 0.594

Actually, our calculation is slightly off. Let's recalculate more carefully, using exact fractions:

For deck A:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9
- P(DS|A) = (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9
- P(SD|A) = (1/3) × (2/3) = 2/9
- P(SS|A) = (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9

For deck B:
- P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.255
- P(DS|B) = (51/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SD|B) = (50/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SS|B) = (50/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.245

For simplicity and clarity, let's approximate deck B as having an equal number of diamonds and spades:
- P(DD|B) ≈ P(DS|B) ≈ P(SD|B) ≈ P(SS|B) ≈ 1/4 = 0.25

Using Bayes' Theorem:

For DD:
- P(A|DD) ≈ (4/9) × (1/2) / [(4/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2)] = (4/9) / (4/9 + 1/4) = 4/9 / (4/9 + 2.25/9) = 4 / (4 + 2.25) ≈ 0.64

For DS or SD:
- P(A|DS) ≈ (2/9) × (1/2) / [(2/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2)] = (2/9) / (2/9 + 1/4) = 2/9 / (2/9 + 2.25/9) = 2 / (2 + 2.25) ≈ 0.47

For SS:
- P(A|SS) ≈ (1/9) × (1/2) / [(1/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2)] = (1/9) / (1/9 + 1/4) = 1/9 / (1/9 + 2.25/9) = 1 / (1 + 2.25) ≈ 0.31

So our strategy is:
- If we observe DD, guess deck A (P(A|DD) ≈ 0.64)
- If we observe DS or SD, guess deck B (P(B|DS) = P(B|SD) ≈ 0.53)
- If we observe SS, guess deck B (P(B|SS) ≈ 0.69)

Now, let's calculate the probability of success with this strategy:

P(DD) ≈ (4/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2) = 2/9 + 1/8 = 16/72 + 9/72 = 25/72 ≈ 0.35
P(DS) = P(SD) ≈ (2/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2) = 1/9 + 1/8 = 8/72 + 9/72 = 17/72 ≈ 0.24
P(SS) ≈ (1/9) × (1/2) + (1/4) × (1/2) = 1/18 + 1/8 = 4/72 + 9/72 = 13/72 ≈ 0.18

P(success) ≈ (25/72) × 0.64 + (17/72) × 0.53 + (17/72) × 0.53 + (13/72) × 0.69
P(success) ≈ 16/72 + 9/72 + 9/72 + 9/72 = 43/72 ≈ 0.60

So the probability of success with this strategy is about 60%.

But is there a better strategy? Let's consider a different approach.

Let's try drawing just one card and seeing if we can get a better success rate:
- P(D|A) = 2/3
- P(D|B) ≈ 1/2
- P(S|A) = 1/3
- P(S|B) ≈ 1/2

Using Bayes' Theorem:
- P(A|D) = (2/3) × (1/2) / [(2/3) × (1/2) + (1/2) × (1/2)] = (2/3) / (2/3 + 1/2) = 2/3 / (4/6 + 3/6) = 2/3 / (7/6) = 4/7 ≈ 0.57
- P(A|S) = (1/3) × (1/2) / [(1/3) × (1/2) + (1/2) × (1/2)] = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/2) = 1/3 / (2/6 + 3/6) = 1/3 / (5/6) = 2/5 = 0.4

So our strategy would be:
- If we draw a diamond, guess deck A (P(A|D) ≈ 0.57)
- If we draw a spade, guess deck B (P(B|S) ≈ 0.6)

The probability of success with this strategy is:
P(success) = P(D) × P(A|D) + P(S) × P(B|S)
P(success) = [(2/3) × (1/2) + (1/2) × (1/2)] × (4/7) + [(1/3) × (1/2) + (1/2) × (1/2)] × (3/5)
P(success) = (7/12) × (4/7) + (5/12) × (3/5)
P(success) = (7/12) × (4/7) + (5/12) × (3/5)
P(success) = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12 ≈ 0.58

So the success rate with this strategy is about 58%. The two-draw strategy seems slightly better.

Let's consider one more approach: draw two cards without replacement:

For deck A:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (1/2) = 1/3
- P(DS|A) = (2/3) × (1/2) = 1/3
- P(SD|A) = (1/3) × (1) = 1/3
- P(SS|A) = (1/3) × (0) = 0 (impossible to draw two spades from deck A)

For deck B (approximating as 50-50):
- P(DD|B) ≈ (1/2) × (49/99) = 49/198 ≈ 0.247
- P(DS|B) ≈ (1/2) × (50/99) = 50/198 ≈ 0.253
- P(SD|B) ≈ (1/2) × (50/99) = 50/198 ≈ 0.253
- P(SS|B) ≈ (1/2) × (49/99) = 49/198 ≈ 0.247

Using Bayes' Theorem:

For DD:
- P(A|DD) ≈ (1/3) × (1/2) / [(1/3) × (1/2) + (0.247) × (1/2)] ≈ 0.574

For DS or SD:
- P(A|DS) ≈ (1/3) × (1/2) / [(1/3) × (1/2) + (0.253) × (1/2)] ≈ 0.568
- P(A|SD) ≈ (1/3) × (1/2) / [(1/3) × (1/2) + (0.253) × (1/2)] ≈ 0.568

For SS:
- P(A|SS) = 0 (since it's impossible to draw two spades from deck A)

So our strategy is:
- If we observe DD, guess deck A
- If we observe DS or SD, guess deck A
- If we observe SS, guess deck B (with certainty)

The probability of success with this strategy is:
P(success) = P(DD) × P(A|DD) + P(DS) × P(A|DS) + P(SD) × P(A|SD) + P(SS) × P(B|SS)

P(DD) ≈ (1/3) × (1/2) + (0.247) × (1/2) ≈ 0.29
P(DS) ≈ P(SD) ≈ (1/3) × (1/2) + (0.253) × (1/2) ≈ 0.293
P(SS) ≈ 0 × (1/2) + (0.247) × (1/2) ≈ 0.124

P(success) ≈ 0.29 × 0.574 + 0.293 × 0.568 + 0.293 × 0.568 + 0.124 × 1
P(success) ≈ 0.167 + 0.166 + 0.166 + 0.124 = 0.623

So the probability of success with this strategy is about 62.3%.

Actually, I made an error in my calculation. Let me approach this differently:

If we draw one card from deck A, the probability of drawing a diamond is 2/3.
If we draw one card from deck B, the probability of drawing a diamond is 51/101 ≈ 0.505.

These probabilities are quite different, suggesting that a simple strategy might work well.

Strategy: Draw a single card. If it's a diamond, guess deck A. If it's a spade, guess deck B.

The probability of success with this strategy is:
P(success) = P(A) × P(D|A) + P(B) × P(S|B)
P(success) = (1/2) × (2/3) + (1/2) × (50/101)
P(success) = (1/2) × (2/3) + (1/2) × (50/101)
P(success) ≈ 0.333 + 0.248 = 0.581

So this simple strategy has a success rate of about 58.1%.

But let's try a slightly different approach: draw a card, replace it, and draw again.

Strategy: Draw two cards with replacement. If both are diamonds, guess deck A. Otherwise, guess deck B.

Probability of success:
P(success) = P(A) × P(A|DD) × P(DD|A) + P(A) × P(B|not DD) × P(not DD|A) + P(B) × P(A|DD) × P(DD|B) + P(B) × P(B|not DD) × P(not DD|B)

Using our earlier calculations:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444
- P(DD|B) ≈ 0.255
- P(not DD|A) = 1 - 0.444 = 0.556
- P(not DD|B) = 1 - 0.255 = 0.745

Using Bayes' Theorem:
- P(A|DD) ≈ 0.64
- P(B|not DD) = 1 - P(A|not DD) ≈ 0.60

Now, the probability of success:
P(success) ≈ (1/2) × 1 × 0.444 + (1/2) × 0.60 × 0.556 + (1/2) × 0 × 0.255 + (1/2) × 1 × 0.745
P(success) ≈ 0.222 + 0.167 + 0 + 0.3725 = 0.7615

This strategy yields a success rate of about 76.15%, which is significantly better than the previous ones.

Let me refine this calculation:

- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444
- P(not DD|A) = 1 - 0.444 = 0.556
- P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.255
- P(not DD|B) = 1 - 0.255 = 0.745

Using Bayes' Theorem:
- P(A|DD) = P(DD|A) × P(A) / [P(DD|A) × P(A) + P(DD|B) × P(B)]
- P(A|DD) = 0.444 × 0.5 / [0.444 × 0.5 + 0.255 × 0.5] = 0.444 / 0.6995 ≈ 0.635

- P(B|not DD) = P(not DD|B) × P(B) / [P(not DD|B) × P(B) + P(not DD|A) × P(A)]
- P(B|not DD) = 0.745 × 0.5 / [0.745 × 0.5 + 0.556 × 0.5] = 0.745 / 1.301 ≈ 0.573

Now, the probability of success:
P(success) = P(DD) × P(A|DD) + P(not DD) × P(B|not DD)
P(success) = 0.350 × 0.635 + 0.650 × 0.573
P(success) ≈ 0.222 + 0.372 = 0.594

So the success rate is about 59.4%.

After careful analysis, the optimal strategy seems to be:
1. Draw two cards with replacement.
2. If both are diamonds, guess deck A.
3. Otherwise (if one or both are spades), guess deck B.

With this strategy, the probability of success is about 0.6 or 3/5.

Let's double check with a slightly different approach. Using Bayes' Theorem and exact fractions where possible:

For deck A:
- P(DD|A) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9
- P(DS|A) = (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9
- P(SD|A) = (1/3) × (2/3) = 2/9
- P(SS|A) = (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9

For deck B (with 51 diamonds and 50 spades):
- P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.255
- P(DS|B) = (51/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SD|B) = (50/101) × (51/101) ≈ 0.250
- P(SS|B) = (50/101) × (50/101) ≈ 0.245

Let's calculate P(A|DD):
P(A|DD) = P(DD|A) × P(A) / [P(DD|A) × P(A) + P(DD|B) × P(B)]
P(A|DD) = (4/9) × (1/2) / [(4/9) × (1/2) + 0.255 × (1/2)]
P(A|DD) = (4/9) / [(4/9) + 0.255]
P(A|DD) = (4/9) / [0.444 + 0.255]
P(A|DD) = (4/9) / 0.699
P(A|DD) ≈ 0.635

Similarly, we can calculate:
P(B|DS or SD) ≈ 0.530
P(B|SS) ≈ 0.688

So our strategy is:
- If we observe DD, guess deck A (P(A|DD) ≈ 0.635)
- If we observe DS, SD, or SS, guess deck B (P(B|DS or SD) ≈ 0.530, P(B|SS) ≈ 0.688)

The probability of success with this strategy is:
P(success) = P(DD) × P(A|DD) + P(DS or SD or SS) × P(B|DS or SD or SS)

We know that:
P(DD) = P(DD|A) × P(A) + P(DD|B) × P(B) = (4/9) × (1/2) + 0.255 × (1/2) ≈ 0.350
P(DS or SD or SS) = 1 - P(DD) = 1 - 0.350 = 0.650

We also know that:
P(B|DS or SD or SS) = P(DS or SD or SS|B) × P(B) / P(DS or SD or SS)
P(B|DS or SD or SS) = (1 - 0.255) × (1/2) / 0.650
P(B|DS or SD or SS) = 0.745 × (1/2) / 0.650
P(B|DS or SD or SS) = 0.373 / 0.650
P(B|DS or SD or SS) ≈ 0.573

So the probability of success is:
P(success) = 0.350 × 0.635 + 0.650 × 0.573
P(success) ≈ 0.222 + 0.372 = 0.594

That's about 59.4% or roughly 3/5.

But I think there's a more direct way to solve this.

Let's use drawing two cards with replacement as our strategy:
1. If both are diamonds, guess deck A.
2. Otherwise, guess deck B.

The probability of success is:
P(success) = P(A) × P(correct guess|A) + P(B) × P(correct guess|B)

P(correct guess|A) = P(guess A|A) = P(DD|A) = 4/9
P(correct guess|B) = P(guess B|B) = P(not DD|B) = 1 - P(DD|B) = 1 - 0.255 = 0.745

Therefore:
P(success) = (1/2) × (4/9) + (1/2) × 0.745
P(success) = (1/2) × (4/9 + 0.745)
P(success) = (1/2) × (0.444 + 0.745)
P(success) = (1/2) × 1.189
P(success) ≈ 0.595

This is about 59.5% or roughly 3/5.

Actually, let's use a more accurate value for P(DD|B):
P(DD|B) = (51/101) × (51/101) = 2601/10201 ≈ 0.255

P(success) = (1/2) × (4/9) + (1/2) × (1 - 2601/10201)
P(success) = (1/2) × (4/9) + (1/2) × (7600/10201)
P(success) = (1/2) × (4/9 + 7600/10201)
P(success) = (1/2) × ((4/9) × 10201 + 7600) / 10201
P(success) = (1/2) × (4534.7 + 7600) / 10201
P(success) = (1/2) × 12134.7 / 10201
P(success) ≈ (1/2) × 1.19
P(success) ≈ 0.595

So the probability of success with this strategy is about 59.5% or roughly 3/5.
