title: 3♦
difficulty: Easy
answer: 1/7

[PROBLEM]
Conditional Dealing

We shuffle a deck of cards and I deal you the **3♦, 4♦, and 5♦**. I look at the next card and tell you that it is between 3 and 8 (inclusive). How likely is it that this card is a ♦?

[HINTS]
Start by considering which cards remain in the deck after dealing you the three diamonds.

[SOLUTION]
After dealing the 3♦, 4♦, and 5♦, we know that the next card is between 3 and 8 inclusive. This gives us only $24-3$ cards possible cards, or $21$ cards.
Out of these $21$ cards, only the 6♦, 7♦, and 8♦ are the diamond cards. Therefore, the probability the card is a ♦ is $\frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7}$
