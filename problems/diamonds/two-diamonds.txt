[PROBLEM]
Same Suit

If you draw $13$ random cards from a standard deck, what is the chance that they are all of the same suit?

[HINTS]
Consider the total number of ways to draw 13 cards from a 52-card deck.

Then consider the number of ways to draw 13 cards from a single suit.

[SOLUTION]
To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 13 cards all of the same suit.

The total number of ways to draw 13 cards from a 52-card deck is $\binom{52}{13}$.

There are 4 suits in a standard deck. For each suit, there are $\binom{13}{13} = 1$ way to draw all 13 cards of that suit.

So the total number of favorable outcomes is 4.

Therefore, the probability is:

$P(\text{all 13 cards are of the same suit}) = \frac{4}{\binom{52}{13}} = \frac{4}{\frac{52!}{13!(52-13)!}} = \frac{4}{\frac{52!}{13!39!}} = \frac{4 \cdot 13! \cdot 39!}{52!}$

After simplification, this equals $\frac{1}{2860}$.
