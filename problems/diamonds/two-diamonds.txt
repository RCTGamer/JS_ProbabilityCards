[PROBLEM]
Same Suit

If you draw $13$ random cards from a standard deck, what is the chance that they are all of the same suit?

[HINTS]
Consider the total number of ways to draw 13 cards from a 52-card deck.

[SOLUTION]
We can draw any card for the first card. Following this, we need the rest of the cards drawn to be the same suit as the first card. 

This gives us the proabilities $\frac{12}{51} \cdot \frac{11}{50} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{1}{40} = \frac{12!39!}{51!} = \frac{1}{\binom{51}{12}}$

We can also think about this as only have $4$ possible ways to get all the suits when we draw $13$ cards. So this is the same as $\frac{4}{\binom{52}{13}}$
