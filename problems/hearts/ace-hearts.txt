[PROBLEM]
Distance from Center of Sphere

A tiny model airplane has gotten stuck inside an inflatable, spherical beach ball of radius $1$ and is flying around randomly. When you stop and look, what is the probability that the plane is closer to the center of the ball than to the outside?

[SOLUTION]
The plane is closer to the center of the ball if it stops flying inside of a sphere with radius $\frac{1}{2}$ with the same center as the beach ball.

Therefore, the probability that the plane is closer to the center is the volume of the sphere with radius $\frac{1}{2}$ divided by the volume of the sphere with radius $1$.

So we have $\frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi (\frac{1}{2})^3}{\frac{4}{3} \pi 1^3} = \frac{1}{8}$.
