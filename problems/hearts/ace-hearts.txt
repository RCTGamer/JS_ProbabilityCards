[PROBLEM]
Circle in a Square

A circle is inscribed in a unit square. If you throw a dart randomly at the square, what is the probability that it lands inside the circle?

[HINTS]
Think about the ratio of areas: the area of the circle compared to the area of the square.

For a unit square, what is the radius of the inscribed circle?

The area of a circle is πr², and the area of a square is side².

[SOLUTION]
We have a unit square (side length = 1) with an inscribed circle.

For a circle inscribed in a unit square:
- The circle's diameter equals the side length of the square
- So the radius r = 1/2

**Area calculations:**
- Area of square = 1² = 1
- Area of circle = πr² = π(1/2)² = π/4

**Probability:**
Since the dart is thrown randomly, the probability of landing in the circle equals the ratio of areas:

P(dart lands in circle) = Area of circle / Area of square = (π/4) / 1 = π/4

Therefore, the probability is **π/4 ≈ 0.785** or about **78.5%**.
