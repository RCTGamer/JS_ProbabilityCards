[PROBLEM]
Cyclists Arriving in the same position

$N$ cyclists are biking around a circular track at a rate of 1 rpm. They start in uniformly random locations and random orientations (clockwise or counter). Just before a pair would collide, they instantly reverse direction. What is the probability that after 1 minute, all cyclists are where they started if:

a) $N$ is odd (for $N = 5$, if your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$ input $100a + b$)
b) $N$ is even (for $N=6$, if your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$ input $100a+b$)

[HINTS]
Consider whether there must be some fixed condition on the positions of the cyclists. And how do we ensure that they end up starting in the same location.

[SOLUTION]
First, we take note that since no cyclist can overtake another hence the rotation must be preserved. 
Moreover, we note that from the logic of the 7♥, we know that every cyclist will simply end up in the initial location of some other cyclist (could also be its own initial location)

Next, suppose that we have $R$ cyclists going clockwise and $L$ cyclists going counter-clockwise. Note that any any given time, we will always have $R$ cyclists going clockwise and $L$ cyclists going counter-clockwise. 

So if we sum the movements of all of the cyclists, we will have $(R-L) \mod n$ rounds towards the clockwise direction, which also represents the number of positions toward the clockwise direction that each cyclists move.

Therefore, the only way for each cyclist will arrive in their initial position is if $L=n$, $R=n$, or $L=R$.

a) 
If $N$ is odd, then since $L+R = n$ where $n$ is odd, we can only have $L=n$ or $R=n$ which happens with probability $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$

b)
If $N$ is even, then we have $L=n$ or $R=n$ or $L = R = \frac{n}{2}$ which happens with probability $\frac{2 + \binom{N}{\frac{N}{2}}}{2^N}$
