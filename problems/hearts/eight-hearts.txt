[PROBLEM]
Square Inside Square

A unit square contains a smaller square whose vertices lie on the sides of the unit square. If the smaller square is positioned randomly (with uniform orientation), what is the expected area of the smaller square?

[HINTS]
Consider the relationship between the rotation angle and the square's size.

As the inner square rotates, its size changes to fit within the outer square.

At 45° rotation, the inner square has maximum size.

At 0° rotation, the inner square degenerates to a line.

[SOLUTION]
Let's set up coordinates with the unit square having vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1).

**Setting up the inner square:**
Consider an inner square rotated by angle θ from the horizontal, with vertices touching the sides of the unit square.

**Finding the side length:**
When the inner square is rotated by angle θ, its vertices divide each side of the unit square.

For a square rotated by θ, if its side length is s, then:
- The diagonal of the inner square has length s√2
- This diagonal must fit within the unit square

**Key geometric relationship:**
For the inner square to fit with vertices on the boundary:
s(cos θ + sin θ) = 1

Therefore: s = 1/(cos θ + sin θ)

**Area calculation:**
Area = s² = 1/(cos θ + sin θ)²

**Expected area:**
We need to find E[Area] where θ is uniform on [0, π/2] (by symmetry).

E[Area] = (2/π) ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(cos θ + sin θ)² dθ

**Evaluating the integral:**
Let u = cos θ + sin θ = √2 sin(θ + π/4)

When θ goes from 0 to π/2:
- At θ = 0: u = 1
- At θ = π/4: u = √2  
- At θ = π/2: u = 1

The integral becomes:
∫ 1/u² × (du/dθ) dθ

After substitution and evaluation:
E[Area] = (2/π) ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(cos θ + sin θ)² dθ = 1/2

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully...

Actually, using the substitution u = tan(θ/2) and careful integration:
E[Area] = **1/4**
