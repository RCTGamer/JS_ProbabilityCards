[PROBLEM]
Cyclists Arriving in the same position

$N$ cyclists are biking around a circular track at a rate of 1 rpm. THey start in uniformly random locations and random orientations (clockwise or counter). Just before a pair would collide, they instantly reverse direction. What is the probability that after 1 minute, all cyclists are where they started if:

a) $N$ is odd
b) $N$ is even

[HINTS]
Consider the relationship between the rotation angle and the square's size.

As the inner square rotates, its size changes to fit within the outer square.

At 45° rotation, the inner square has maximum size.

At 0° rotation, the inner square degenerates to a line.

[SOLUTION]
a)
If $N$ is odd, then we have probability $\frac{2}{2^N} = \frac{1}{2^{N-1}}$

b)
If $N$ is even, then we have probability $\frac{2 + \binom{N}{\frac{N}{2}}}{2^N}$
