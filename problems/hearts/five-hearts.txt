answer: $\frac{2(l^2 + w^2)}{wl(l+w)}$

[PROBLEM]
Stopping over diagonal lines

A circular zamboni (of radius $1$) was driving around an ice rink of length $l$ and width $w$ ($l, w \ge 2$). The zamboni broke down at a uniformly random point on the rink. What is the chance that it stopped over a diagonal line?

[HINTS]
Consider the distances from the diagonals to each side.

[SOLUTION]
For each corner, if the circular zamboni broke down on the width, it's center must be less than $\frac{w}{l}$ units away from the corner for the zamboni to lie on the diagonal. 

Similarly, the circular zamboni broke down on the length, it's center must be less than $\frac{l}{w}$ units away from the corner for the zamboni to lie on the diagonal.

Since $l,w > 2$, then we don't need to worry about overlapping areas in different corners. Since we have $4$ corners, then we have a total of $4(\frac{w}{l} + \frac{l}{w})$ lines where the zamboni can break down.

Dividing by the total length, we have $\frac{4 \cdot (\frac{l}{w} + \frac{w}{l})}{2(w+l)} = \frac{2(l^2 + w^2)}{wl(l+w)}$.
