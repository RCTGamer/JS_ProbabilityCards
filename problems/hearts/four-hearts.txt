[PROBLEM]
Buffon's Needle Variation

A round helicopter of diameter $3$ is trying to land. Its landing zone is covered in painted lines which form a grid of $4\times 4$ squares (each square has length $4$). The helicopter is supposed to land fully within a square, but the pilot did not pay attention and landed randomly. What is the chance that the helicopter falls within a square nonetheless.

(If your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$, Find $100a + b$)

[HINTS]
Consider where the center of the circle can lie within the square.

[SOLUTION]
We analyze this case for a single $4\times 4$ square.

Note that since the round helicopter has a diameter of $3$ or radius of $1.5$, then the center of the helicopter must be $1.5$ units away from each of the edges of each square.

From above, we know that the center can only lie in a $1\times 1$ square cenetered in the same $4\times 4$ sqaure. Therefore, we know that we have a probability of $\frac{1}{16}$ for the helicopter to land completely within a square.

We can generalize this to be true for the entire landing zone, which gives us a final probability of $\frac{1}{16}$.
