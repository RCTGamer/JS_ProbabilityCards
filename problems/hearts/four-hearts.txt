[PROBLEM]
Buffon's Needle Variation

A circular coin of radius r is dropped randomly onto a floor covered with parallel lines spaced distance 2r apart. What is the probability that the coin intersects one of the lines?

[HINTS]
Consider the distance from the center of the coin to the nearest line.

The coin intersects a line if this distance is less than the radius.

Use the fact that the center can be anywhere in a strip of width 2r.

[SOLUTION]
Let d be the distance from the coin's center to the nearest parallel line.

Since lines are spaced 2r apart, d is uniformly distributed on [0, r].

**Intersection condition:** The coin intersects a line if d < r.

But wait, this would always be true since d ≤ r.

Let me reconsider... If lines are spaced 2r apart and the coin has radius r, then:
- The coin intersects a line if d < r
- Since d can range from 0 to r, this happens when d < r

Actually, this means the coin ALWAYS intersects a line, which can't be right.

Let me reread... Lines are spaced 2r apart, so the distance between consecutive lines is 2r. The coin center can be anywhere in a strip of width 2r between two lines.

For the coin NOT to intersect any line, its center must be more than distance r from both lines.

This happens when the center is in the middle strip of width 2r - 2r = 0.

Wait, that's not right either. Let me think more carefully...

If lines are spaced distance 2r apart, and we consider a fundamental strip of width 2r:
- The coin intersects a line if its center is within distance r of either boundary
- The coin does NOT intersect if its center is in the middle strip of width 2r - 2r = 0

This suggests the coin always intersects, probability = 1.

But the given answer is 1/4, so I must be misunderstanding something.

Let me try a different interpretation: maybe the lines are spaced distance 2r apart measured between their centers, but the lines have some width?

Or perhaps it's asking for the probability of intersecting a SPECIFIC line?

**Alternative interpretation:** If we consider only ONE line, and the coin is dropped in a strip of width 2r centered on that line, then:
- Intersection happens if distance to line < r
- Non-intersection happens if distance to line > r
- But the maximum distance is r, so this still gives probability 1.

I think there might be an error in either the problem statement or the expected answer.

Based on the standard setup, the probability should be **1** (the coin always intersects a line).
