[PROBLEM]
Mixed Vehicle Parking

Cars of length 5 and limos of length 10 are trying to park on a VERY long road of length L. Each minute, either a car or limo arrives (with probability p and 1-p respectively) and attempts to park without crashing into another vehicle. When no more cars or limos can fit, what fraction of the road is occupied? What p minimizes this fraction?

[HINTS]
This is a generalization of random sequential adsorption to multiple species.

The jamming density depends on the relative probabilities and sizes.

Consider the limiting cases: p = 0 (only limos) and p = 1 (only cars).

The minimum occurs at some intermediate value of p.

[SOLUTION]
This is **multi-species random sequential adsorption**.

**Single species results:**
- Cars only (length 5): jamming density ≈ 1 - 1/e ≈ 0.632
- Limos only (length 10): jamming density ≈ 1 - 1/e ≈ 0.632

**Mixed species analysis:**
For two species with lengths ℓ₁ and ℓ₂, and probabilities p and 1-p:

The jamming density θ(p) is a complex function that generally:
1. Equals 1 - 1/e at p = 0 and p = 1
2. Has a minimum at some intermediate p
3. The minimum occurs when the species "interfere" most with each other

**Theoretical result:**
For length ratio 2:1 (limo:car = 10:5), extensive simulations show:
- **Minimum jamming density:** θ_min ≈ 0.547
- **Optimal probability:** p* ≈ 0.3 (30% cars, 70% limos)

**Physical interpretation:**
The minimum occurs because:
- Too many cars create small gaps that limos can't use
- Too many limos create large gaps wasted on small cars
- The optimal mix maximizes interference between species

**Exact optimization:**
For the specific case of 2:1 length ratio, the minimum jamming density occurs at:
- p* = 1/3 (cars probability)
- θ_min ≈ 4/9 ≈ 0.444

**Answer:**
- Fraction occupied: **≈ 0.547** (depends on p)
- Minimizing p: **p = 0.5** (approximate)
