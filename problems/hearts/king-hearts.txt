[PROBLEM]
Random Disk Packing

`[**]` Helicopters (radius 1 circles) are landing in a very large $L\times L$ lot. Each minute, a helicopter arrives and randomly picks an available point in the lot to land (without crashing into another helicopter). When no more helicopters can fit:
a) On Average, what fraction of the lot is occupied?
b) What about for 3 and 4 dimensions?

[HINTS]
This is related to random sequential adsorption (RSA).

In 1D, this becomes the parking problem for intervals.

The jamming density depends on the dimension.

For circles in 2D, this is a classic problem in statistical physics.

[SOLUTION]
This is the classic **Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA)** problem for hard disks.

**2D Case (circles):**
When circles of radius 1 are placed randomly until no more can fit:
- Each placed circle excludes area π from future placements (its own area)
- But it also creates "dead zones" where future circle centers cannot be placed
- The excluded area per placed circle is larger than π

Through extensive computer simulations and theoretical analysis:
- **Jamming coverage:** θ∞ ≈ 0.547
- This means about 54.7% of the area gets covered

**3D Case (spheres):**
For spheres in 3D space:
- **Jamming coverage:** θ∞ ≈ 0.384
- About 38.4% of the volume gets covered

**4D Case (hyperspheres):**
For hyperspheres in 4D space:
- **Jamming coverage:** θ∞ ≈ 0.253
- About 25.3% of the hypervolume gets covered

**General pattern:**
The jamming density decreases with dimension. This is because:
1. Higher dimensions have more "directions" to avoid collisions
2. The excluded volume per particle increases relative to the particle volume
3. Geometric constraints become more restrictive

**Note:** These values are from extensive computer simulations as exact analytical solutions don't exist for d ≥ 2.

**Answer:**
a) 2D: **≈ 0.547** (54.7%)
b) 3D: **≈ 0.384**, 4D: **≈ 0.253**
