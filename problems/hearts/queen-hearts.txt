[PROBLEM]
Parking Gap Analysis

`[**]` Cars of length 2 try to park on a length L road. Each minute, a new car parks at a uniformly random spot on the road without crashing into another car or running off the road. When no more cars fit:
a) What is the expected size of the largest gap between adjacent cars (as a function of L)?
b) How about the smallest gap between adjacent cars?

[HINTS]
After jamming, all gaps have length < 2 (otherwise another car could fit).

The number of gaps grows proportionally to L.

For the maximum: think about extreme value statistics.

For the minimum: consider the distribution of gap sizes.

[SOLUTION]
After the parking process jams, we have approximately L/3.17 cars (from jamming density 1-1/e) and thus about L/3.17 gaps.

**Part (a): Largest gap**

In random sequential adsorption, the gap sizes follow an exponential distribution with rate λ = 1 (in units where car length = 1, so gaps < 1).

For our problem with car length 2, gaps have size < 2.

**Gap size distribution:**
f(x) = e^(-x) for 0 ≤ x < 2 (rescaled)

**Extreme value theory:**
For n i.i.d. exponential random variables with rate 1:
E[max] ≈ ln(n)

With n ≈ L/3.17 gaps:
**E[largest gap] ≈ ln(L/3.17) ≈ ln(L) - ln(3.17) ≈ ln(L) - 1.15**

For large L: **E[largest gap] ≈ ln(L)**

**Part (b): Smallest gap**

For the minimum of n exponential random variables:
E[min] ≈ 1/n

With n ≈ L/3.17:
**E[smallest gap] ≈ 3.17/L**

**Summary:**
a) **Largest gap: ≈ ln(L)**
b) **Smallest gap: ≈ 3.17/L**

**Physical interpretation:**
- The largest gap grows logarithmically with road length
- The smallest gap shrinks inversely with road length
- This reflects the exponential distribution of gap sizes in jammed configurations
