[PROBLEM]
Cyclists Meeting on a track

$N$ cyclists are biking around a circular track at a rate of 1 rpm. THey start in uniformly random locations and random orientations (clockwise or counter). Just before a pair would collide, they instantly reverse direction. What is the expected number of times all the cyclists reverse direction each minute?

(Find the answer for $N=12$)

[HINTS]
Does the "instantly reverse direction" condition matter? and think about each cyclist individually

[SOLUTION]
Note that having the pair of bikers instantly reverse direction is the same as letting them simply pass through each other since we don't care about the identity of the bikers.

So, we simply wish to find the number of times cyclists "pass by each other"

For every pair of cyclist, they have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of meeting, which is when one of them turns clockwise and the other moves counter clockwise.

Since we have $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ pairs of cyclists, then by linearity of expectation, we expect $\frac{N(N-1)}{4}$ cyclists to "pass by each other" each minute.
