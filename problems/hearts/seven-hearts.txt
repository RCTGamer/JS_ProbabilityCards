[PROBLEM]
Random Chord Length

A chord is drawn at random in a circle of radius 1. What is the probability that the chord is longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle?

[HINTS]
There are different ways to interpret "random chord" - this affects the answer!

Assume the chord is determined by choosing two random points on the circle.

Find the side length of an inscribed equilateral triangle in a unit circle.

The chord length depends on the central angle between the two points.

[SOLUTION]
**Step 1: Side length of inscribed equilateral triangle**
For an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R = 1:
- The central angle for each side is 2π/3 = 120°
- Side length = 2R sin(π/3) = 2 × 1 × (√3/2) = √3

**Step 2: Random chord setup**
Choose two random points A and B on the circle. Let θ be the central angle between them.
Since the points are chosen uniformly, θ is uniformly distributed on [0, π].
(We consider only the smaller arc, so θ ≤ π)

**Step 3: Chord length formula**
For central angle θ, the chord length is:
L = 2R sin(θ/2) = 2 sin(θ/2)

**Step 4: Condition for long chord**
We want L > √3:
2 sin(θ/2) > √3
sin(θ/2) > √3/2
θ/2 > π/3
θ > 2π/3

**Step 5: Probability calculation**
Since θ is uniform on [0, π]:
P(chord longer than triangle side) = P(θ > 2π/3) = (π - 2π/3)/π = (π/3)/π = 1/3

**Alternative interpretation:**
Note: This assumes we pick two random points on the circle. Other interpretations of "random chord" (like random midpoint, or random direction through random point) give different answers (1/2 and 1/4 respectively). This is known as **Bertrand's Paradox**.

**Answer: 1/3**
