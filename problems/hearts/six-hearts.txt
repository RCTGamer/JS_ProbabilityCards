[PROBLEM]
Meeting Time Window

Every morning, two friends independently bike to a cafe, arriving at a uniformly random time between 7am and 8am. Each person waits for t minutes in the parking lot, hoping their friend will join in time. If not, they leave coffeeless. If they are 36% likely to get their morning caffeine, what is t?

[HINTS]
Set up a coordinate system where x and y represent arrival times.

The constraint is that |x - y| ≤ t for them to meet.

This creates a band around the diagonal y = x.

The probability equals the area of this band divided by the total area.

[SOLUTION]
Let x and y be the arrival times of the two friends, measured in minutes after 7am.
Both x and y are uniformly distributed on [0, 60].

**Meeting condition:** They meet if |x - y| ≤ t, which means:
-t ≤ x - y ≤ t, or equivalently: y ∈ [x-t, x+t]

**Geometric setup:**
- Total sample space: 60 × 60 square with area 3600
- Meeting region: band of width 2t around the diagonal y = x

**Area calculation:**
The region where they DON'T meet consists of two triangles:
- Upper triangle: y > x + t
- Lower triangle: y < x - t

Each triangle has legs of length (60 - t).
Area of each triangle = (1/2)(60 - t)²
Total "no meeting" area = 2 × (1/2)(60 - t)² = (60 - t)²

**Meeting area:** 3600 - (60 - t)² = 3600 - (3600 - 120t + t²) = 120t - t²

**Probability:** P = (120t - t²)/3600 = 0.36

**Solving:** 120t - t² = 0.36 × 3600 = 1296
t² - 120t + 1296 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
t = (120 ± √(14400 - 5184))/2 = (120 ± √9216)/2 = (120 ± 96)/2

So t = 108 or t = 12.

Since t must be less than 60 (can't wait longer than the full hour), we have **t = 12 minutes**.

**Verification:** P = (120×12 - 144)/3600 = (1440 - 144)/3600 = 1296/3600 = 0.36 ✓
