[PROBLEM]
Meeting Time Window

Every morning, two friends independently bike to a cafe, arriving at a uniformly random time between 7am and 8am. Each person waits for $t$ minutes in the parking lot, hoping their friend will join in time. If not, they leave coffeeless. If they are 36% likely to get their morning caffeine, what is $t$?

[HINTS]
Set up the contraints as an inequality in terms of the number of minutes they arrive after 7am. 

[SOLUTION]
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the arrival times of the two friends, measured in minutes after 7am. Both $X$ and $Y$ are uniformly distributed on $[0, 60]$.

Then they meet if $|X-Y| \le t$. Hence, if we plot this region on the coordinate plane restricted to $X,Y \in [0,60]$, we know that this has an area of $3600 - (60-t)^2$

This gives a probability of meeting being $\frac{3600 - (60-t)^2}{3600} = 0.36 \implies \frac{(60-t)^2}{60^2} = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \implies \frac{60-t}{60} = 0.8 \implies t = 12$
