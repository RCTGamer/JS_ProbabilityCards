[PROBLEM]
Cyclists on a Sphere

Two cyclists are randomly biking around the unit circle. They each stop at uniformly random spots along the boundary. Form a triangle from the two cyclists and the circle's center.

a) How likely is the triangle to be acute? 
b) If the unit circle was a unit sphere instead, how likely is the trinagle acute?

[HINTS]
Find the arc in the circle / region on the sphere the two points need to form an acute triangle

[SOLUTION]
a)
Note that for the two points to form an acute triangle, then the arc formed by the two points must be less than $90^\circ$. 

Suppose the first point lies somewhere randomly, then the second point can lie $90^\circ$ clockwise or $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise, which has a probaibility of $\frac{1}{2}$ since this is roughly half the circumference of the circle.

b)
Similarly, If the first point lies somewhere randomly, then the second point can lie anywhere on the semisphere with the first point being on the "center" of the surface area of this semisphere.

This also happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
