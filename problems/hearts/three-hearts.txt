[PROBLEM]
Triangle on a Circle

Two points are chosen uniformly at random on a circle. A triangle is formed using these two points and the center of the circle. What is the probability that this triangle is acute?

[HINTS]
An angle inscribed in a circle has a specific relationship to the central angle.

Consider the arc length between the two random points.

A triangle is acute if all angles are less than 90°.

The angle at the center depends on the arc between the two points.

[SOLUTION]
Let's place the circle at the origin with radius 1, and consider two random points A and B on the circle.

The triangle is formed by points A, B, and the center O.

**Key insight:** Since OA = OB = 1 (radii), triangle OAB is isosceles.

Let θ be the central angle ∠AOB (the arc between A and B).

In the isosceles triangle OAB:
- The angle at O is θ
- The two base angles are each (π - θ)/2

**For the triangle to be acute, all angles must be < π/2:**

1) Angle at O: θ < π/2
2) Base angles: (π - θ)/2 < π/2
   This gives: π - θ < π, so θ > 0 (always true)

**But we also need the base angles to be acute:**
(π - θ)/2 < π/2
π - θ < π
This is always satisfied.

**However, we need θ < π/2 for the angle at O to be acute.**

But wait, there's another constraint. Since we pick two random points on a circle, the angle θ can be anywhere from 0 to π (we always measure the smaller arc).

**For acute triangle:**
- Central angle θ < π/2
- Base angles (π - θ)/2 < π/2, which gives θ > 0

So we need 0 < θ < π/2.

**Probability calculation:**
Since points are chosen uniformly on the circle, θ is uniformly distributed on [0, π].

P(acute) = P(0 < θ < π/2) = (π/2)/(π) = 1/2

Wait, this doesn't match the given answer of 3/4. Let me reconsider...

Actually, let me think about this differently. If we place one point fixed and the second point randomly, the angle between them is uniformly distributed on [0, 2π]. But due to symmetry, we can consider it on [0, π].

For the triangle to be acute:
- θ < π/2 (angle at center)
- (π - θ)/2 < π/2, which gives θ > 0

So we need θ ∈ (0, π/2).

But actually, if θ > π/2, then the base angles become:
(π - θ)/2 where θ > π/2
This means (π - θ)/2 < π/4, so these are acute.
But the angle at the center θ > π/2 is obtuse.

So the triangle is acute only when θ < π/2.

The probability should be 1/2, not 3/4.

Let me reconsider the problem statement... Perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Actually, rereading: if we consider ALL possible triangles (not just measuring the smaller arc), then θ can be anywhere from 0 to 2π.

For acute triangle: 0 < θ < π/2 OR 3π/2 < θ < 2π

Total favorable: π/2 + π/2 = π
Total possible: 2π
Probability = π/(2π) = 1/2

I'm still not getting 3/4. The answer might need verification.
