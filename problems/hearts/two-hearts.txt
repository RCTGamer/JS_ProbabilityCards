[PROBLEM]
Meeting Time Window

Two friends agree to meet at a cafe between 2pm and 3pm. Each arrives at a random time during this hour and waits exactly 10 minutes before leaving. What is the probability that they meet?

[HINTS]
Set up coordinates where x and y represent the arrival times of the two friends.

The constraint is that they meet if |x - y| ≤ 10 minutes.

Convert this to a geometric probability problem in a unit square.

[SOLUTION]
Let's represent the arrival times as coordinates (x, y) where both x and y range from 0 to 60 minutes.

The total sample space is a 60×60 square with area 3600.

**Meeting condition:** The friends meet if |x - y| ≤ 10, which means:
- y ≤ x + 10 AND y ≥ x - 10

**Geometric approach:**
The region where they DON'T meet consists of two triangles:
- Upper triangle: y > x + 10
- Lower triangle: y < x - 10

**Calculating areas:**
- Upper triangle area = (1/2) × 50 × 50 = 1250
- Lower triangle area = (1/2) × 50 × 50 = 1250
- Total "no meeting" area = 2500

**Meeting area:** 3600 - 2500 = 1100

**Probability:** 1100/3600 = 11/36 ≈ 0.306

Wait, let me recalculate...

Actually, the meeting area is easier to calculate directly:
Meeting region area = 3600 - 2 × (1/2) × 50² = 3600 - 2500 = 1100

P(meeting) = 1100/3600 = 11/36

But this seems incorrect. Let me reconsider...

The area where |x-y| ≤ 10 in a 60×60 square:
Total area = 3600
Area where they don't meet = 2 × (1/2) × 50² = 2500
Area where they meet = 3600 - 2500 = 1100

P(meeting) = 1100/3600 = 11/36

Hmm, but 7/36 was given as the answer. Let me check if there's a different interpretation...

Actually, if we consider a unit square (0,1) × (0,1) and the meeting window is 10/60 = 1/6:

Area of meeting region = 1 - 2 × (1/2) × (5/6)² = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36

This doesn't match either. Let me try once more...

If the meeting window is 10 minutes out of 60, then in unit coordinates, the constraint is |x-y| ≤ 1/6.

The area where they don't meet is: 2 × (1/2) × (5/6)² = 25/36

So the area where they DO meet is: 1 - 25/36 = 11/36

This still doesn't give 7/36. There might be an error in the expected answer, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

The correct answer should be **11/36**.
