[PROBLEM]
Sum of Distances

Two planes are getting ready for takeoff, travelling down a long runway at $60$mph and $180$mph respectively. They both suddenly stop (and independently) after 0-60s (uniformly at random). What is the chance that the sum of the distances traveled is at most a mile?

(If your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$, Find $100a + b$)

[HINTS]
Find a way to express the time where they meet as an equation in $X,Y$ where $X,Y$ are the time until the planes 1 and 2 stop respectively

[SOLUTION] 
Let $X,Y$ be the time until the plane travelling $60, 180$ mph stops in seconds respectively.

The sum of the distances travelled being less than a mile is equivalent to $X + 3Y \le 1$

Plotting $X + 3Y \le 1$ that lies inside $X,Y \in [0,60]$ gives an area of $\frac{600}{3600} = \frac{1}{6}$
