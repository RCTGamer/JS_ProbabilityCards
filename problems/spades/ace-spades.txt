[PROBLEM]
**Two Crabs Random Walk**

Two crabs are facing each other on the beach. Each second they randomly walk one step to the right or one step to the left (independently). After $6$ seconds, what is the chance they are still across from each other?

[HINT]
Consider the relative position between the two crabs. Think about what it means for them to be "across from each other" after 6 steps.

[SOLUTION]
Let's denote the relative position between the two crabs. Initially they are distance 0 apart.

Each second, the relative distance changes by:
- +2 with probability 1/4 (both move away from each other)
- 0 with probability 1/2 (one moves toward, one away)  
- -2 with probability 1/4 (both move toward each other)

For them to be across from each other after 6 seconds, their relative distance must be 0.

This is equivalent to a random walk where we move +1 with probability 1/4, stay at 0 with probability 1/2, and move -1 with probability 1/4.

After 6 steps, the probability of being at position 0 is $\frac{5}{16} = 0.3125$.
