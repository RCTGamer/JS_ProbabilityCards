[PROBLEM]
**Bunny Nap Decision**

A bunny cannot decide where to take a nap. There is a rose bush $4$ steps to the left and sunflowers $8$ steps to the right. The bunny is $25\%$ likely to step toward the roses and $75\%$ likely to step toward the sunflowers. How many steps (on average) does it take until the bunny can get some rest?

[HINT]
This is a random walk between two absorbing barriers. Use the formula for expected hitting times in a biased random walk.

[SOLUTION]
Let $E_k$ be the expected number of steps to reach either boundary when starting $k$ steps from the left barrier (roses).

The bunny starts at position 4 (4 steps from roses, 8 steps from sunflowers).

For a biased random walk with probability $p = 0.75$ of moving right and $q = 0.25$ of moving left between barriers at 0 and 12:

$E_k = \frac{k}{q-p} - \frac{12}{q-p} \cdot \frac{1-(q/p)^k}{1-(q/p)^{12}}$

With $p = 0.75$, $q = 0.25$, so $q/p = 1/3$ and $q-p = -0.5$.

$E_4 = \frac{4}{-0.5} - \frac{12}{-0.5} \cdot \frac{1-(1/3)^4}{1-(1/3)^{12}}$

$E_4 = -8 + 24 \cdot \frac{1-1/81}{1-1/531441} = 16$
