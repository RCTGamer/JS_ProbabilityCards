[PROBLEM]
**Hawk 3D Random Walk**

[*] A hawk is flying around in 3D space. Don't worry-- it is not bound by silly rules like gravity and can burrow deep into the ground. Every moment, it takes a step in one of six directions, horizontal, vertical, or forward/backward direction. What is the probability that the hawk ever returns to where it started?

[HINT]
This is about 3D random walk recurrence. Unlike 1D and 2D, 3D random walks have different behavior.

[SOLUTION]
This is another classic result in random walk theory. For a simple symmetric random walk in 3D (where each step is equally likely to be in any of the 6 directions: ±x, ±y, ±z), the random walk is **transient**.

The probability of ever returning to the starting point is:

$$P(\text{return to origin}) = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma(1/6)\Gamma(1/3)}{\Gamma(1/2)} \approx 0.3405$$

This can be calculated using the formula:
$$P = 1 - \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{1}{3 - \cos(x) - \cos(y) - \cos(z)} dx dy dz$$

The key insight is that in 3D and higher dimensions, random walks are transient, meaning there's a positive probability of never returning to the starting point.

Dimensions 1 and 2: recurrent (return probability = 1)
Dimensions 3 and higher: transient (return probability < 1)
