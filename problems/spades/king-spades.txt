answer: a) 8 walks, b) Approximately mu^n

[PROBLEM]
**Dog Manhattan Walk**

Your dog is taking itself for a walk around Manhattan, a perfect infinite 2D grid. Your dog likes to explore, so it never wants to visit the same block twice.

a) How many $4$-block walks could your dog take?

b) How about $n$-block walks for large $n$?

[HINT]
This is about self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. Part (a) can be solved by enumeration, part (b) involves the connective constant.

[SOLUTION]
**Part a)** For 4-step self-avoiding walks on the square lattice starting from a given point:

Starting from the origin, we can enumerate all possible 4-step paths that don't revisit any vertex:
- First step: 4 choices (N, S, E, W)
- Second step: 3 choices (can't go back)
- Third step: depends on configuration
- Fourth step: depends on configuration

By systematic enumeration, there are exactly **8** distinct 4-step self-avoiding walks from any starting vertex on the square lattice.

**Part b)** For large $n$, the number of $n$-step self-avoiding walks grows approximately as:

$$c_n \sim A \cdot \mu^n \cdot n^{\gamma-1}$$

For the square lattice:
- $\mu \approx 2.6381$ (connective constant, known only numerically)
- $\gamma = 43/32 = 1.34375$ (critical exponent)

So for large $n$:
$$c_n \approx A \cdot (2.6381)^n \cdot n^{0.34375}$$

The exact value of the connective constant for the square lattice is one of the famous unsolved problems in combinatorics.
