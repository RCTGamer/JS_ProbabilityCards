[PROBLEM]
**Bee Hexagonal Lattice Walk**

[*] A bee is wandering around an infinitely large beehive, walking along the edges of a hexagonal honeycomb 2D lattice. This bee is very efficient and does not want to walk along an edge it previously walked on. For very large $n$, approximately how many possible $n$-step walks are there that the bee could take from a given starting position?

[HINT]
This is about self-avoiding walks on the hexagonal lattice. The growth rate is related to the connective constant of the lattice.

[SOLUTION]
This problem asks for the number of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) of length $n$ on the hexagonal lattice.

For large $n$, the number of $n$-step self-avoiding walks from a given starting point behaves asymptotically as:

$$c_n \sim A \cdot \mu^n \cdot n^{\gamma-1}$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the connective constant of the hexagonal lattice
- $\gamma$ is a critical exponent  
- $A$ is a constant

For the hexagonal lattice:
- $\mu = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} \approx 1.8478$
- $\gamma = 43/32 = 1.34375$

The connective constant $\mu$ can be computed exactly for the hexagonal lattice, unlike for the square lattice where it's only known numerically.

So for large $n$:
$$c_n \approx A \cdot (1.8478)^n \cdot n^{0.34375}$$

The hexagonal lattice is special because it's the only regular lattice where the connective constant is known exactly.
