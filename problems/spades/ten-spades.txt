[PROBLEM]
**Antelope 2D Random Walk**

A confused antelope is looking for food and each second takes a random step equally likely to be N, S, E, or W. What is the probability that the antelope ever makes it back to where it started?

[HINT]
This is a 2D symmetric random walk recurrence problem. Consider the fundamental properties of random walks in different dimensions.

[SOLUTION]
This is a classic result in probability theory about random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$.

For a simple symmetric random walk in 2D (where each step is equally likely to be in any of the 4 cardinal directions), the probability of eventually returning to the starting point is exactly 1.

This can be proven using generating functions or Fourier analysis. The key insight is that:

$$P(\text{return to origin}) = \left(\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2 - \cos(x) - \cos(y)} dx dy\right)^{-1} = 1$$

This is in contrast to 1D (where return probability is also 1) and 3D (where return probability is approximately 0.34).

The result follows from the fact that in 2D, the random walk is recurrent, meaning that almost surely the walker will return to any given point infinitely often.
