[PROBLEM]
**Turtle Ocean Walk**

A turtle is staring out at the horizon, one step away from the ocean. The turtle takes random steps, with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ back toward the top of the beach and with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ toward the ocean. What's the chance the turtle ever makes it to the ocean?

[HINT]
This is a biased random walk with an absorbing barrier. Set up a recursive equation for the probability of reaching the ocean from each position.

[SOLUTION]
Let $p_k$ be the probability of reaching the ocean when the turtle is $k$ steps away from it.

We want to find $p_1$.

Setting up the recursive equation:
- $p_0 = 1$ (already at ocean)
- $p_k = \frac{1}{3} p_{k-1} + \frac{2}{3} p_{k+1}$ for $k \geq 1$

This gives us the general solution $p_k = A + B \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k$.

Using boundary conditions:
- $p_0 = 1$
- $\lim_{k \to \infty} p_k = 0$

We get $A = 0$ and $B = 1$, so $p_k = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k$.

Therefore, $p_1 = \frac{1}{2}$.
