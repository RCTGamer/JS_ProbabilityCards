[PROBLEM]
**Turtle Ocean Walk**

A turtle is staring out at the horizon, one step away from the ocean. The turtle takes random steps, with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ back toward the top of the beach and with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ toward the ocean. What's the chance the turtle ever makes it to the ocean?

[HINT]
This is a biased random walk with an absorbing barrier. Set up a recursive equation for the probability of reaching the ocean from each position.

[SOLUTION]
Let $p_{i,n}$ be the probability of ending up in the ocean when the turtle is $i$ steps away from the ocean and if the turtle stops moving when it is $n$ steps away from the ocean.

We want to find $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} p_{1,n}$

Therefore, $p_1 = \frac{1}{2}$.
