[PROBLEM]
**Turtle Ocean Walk**

A turtle is staring out at the horizon, one step away from the ocean. The turtle takes random steps, with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ back toward the top of the beach and with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ toward the ocean. What's the chance the turtle ever makes it to the ocean?

(If your answer is in $\frac{a}{b}$, Find $100a + b$)

[HINT]
This is a biased random walk with an absorbing barrier. Set up a recursive equation for the probability of reaching the ocean from each position.

[SOLUTION]
Let $p_{i}$ be the probability of ending up in the ocean when the turtle is $i$ steps away from the Ocean

Then note that $p_{2} = p_{1}^2$ since getting to the ocean when you are two steps away needs you to first get to the "one step away", followed by actually getting to the ocean. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation $p_1 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} p_2 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} p_1^2 \implies p_1 = 1,\frac{1}{2}$ and it is clearly the later option.
