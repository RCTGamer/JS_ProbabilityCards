[PROBLEM]
**Ant Trail Patterns**

A bee left some honeycomb on the ground and now a very long trail of red and black ants (in random order) has formed.

a) Which is more likely to appear first in the trail, two black ants in a row (**BB**) or a red ant followed by a black ant (**RB**)? Answer $0$ for **BB** and $1$ otherwise.

b) How many ants does it take on average to see **BB** or **RB**?

c) What about **BBR**?

[HINT]
This is a Markov chain problem. Consider the states based on what patterns you've seen so far.

[SOLUTION]
a)
If **R** appears even once in the first two ants, then its impossible to see **BB** before **RB**. Therefore, we see **BB** first if and only if it appears as the first two ants, which happens with proabiblity $\frac{1}{4}$. Otherwise, we see **RB** first for $\frac{3}{4}$ of the time. So, we are more likely to see **RB** first.

b) 
We will see **BB** or **RB** if **B** appears any time from the second ant onwards. $E[B] = 2$ since a **B** appears just as likely as **R**, so it takes $1 + E[B] = 3$

c)
The expected value of seeing **BBR** is to first see **BB** then for the next *R* to appear anytime after **BB** appears. This is equivalent to $E[BBR] = E[BB] + E[R]$

$E[BB] = \frac{1}{2}(E[B] + 1) + \frac{1}{2} E[BB] \implies \frac{1}{2} E[BB] = \frac{1}{2}(2 + 1) \implies E[BB] = 6$
$E[R] = 2$

So we have $E[BBR] = 6 + 2 = 8$
