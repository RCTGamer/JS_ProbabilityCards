[PROBLEM]
**Ant Trail Patterns**

A bee left some honeycomb on the ground and now a very long trail of red and black ants (in random order) has formed.

a) Which is more likely to appear first in the trail, two black ants in a row (**BB**) or a red ant followed by a black ant (**RB**)?

b) How many ants does it take on average to see **BB** or **RB**?

c) What about **BBR**?

[HINT]
This is a Markov chain problem. Consider the states based on what patterns you've seen so far.

[SOLUTION]
**Part a)** Both BB and RB have the same probability of appearing first. Each has probability 1/2.

**Part b)** Using Markov chain analysis, the expected number of ants to see either BB or RB is 3.

**Part c)** For the pattern BBR, the expected waiting time is 8 ants.

The key insight is to set up states representing the progress toward completing each pattern and solve the resulting system of linear equations.
